# YAMP (Yet Another Media Player)  Î±

I am creating this project in order to learn about a popular Audio Library for .NET [CSCore](https://github.com/filoe/cscore). This is a simple media player in its very beginning stage (hence alpha ðŸ˜›) and right now has many sections broken and incomplete. 

My prime objective of creating this project is to learn about the library as it is pretty much undocumented for beginners like me. The more I'll be learning about it and implementing its functionality in this player the more this player become a beginner friendly guide for everyone trying to learn CSCore.
 
## Libraries used
* CSCore
* TagLibSharp
* MediaInfo

Note that both libraries **TagLibSharp** and **MediaInfo** (used for reading Tag data) are currently included in the project as of now but after some time I'm planning to keep only one which ever will be more suitable.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. In fact if there is an issue in existing code I request you to correct that too with a proper explanation in a noob friendly way ðŸ¥º.

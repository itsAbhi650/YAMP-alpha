# YAMP (Yet Another Media Player)  Î±


I am creating this project in order to learn about a popular Audio Library for .NET [CSCore](https://github.com/filoe/cscore). This is a simple media player in its very beginning stage (hence alpha ðŸ˜›) and right now has many sections broken and incomplete. 

My prime objective of creating this project is to learn about the library as it is pretty much undocumented for beginners like me. The more I'll be learning about it and implementing its functionality in this player the more this player become a beginner friendly guide for everyone trying to learn CSCore.

ON ERROR - DLL NOT FOUND:

With the installation of the CSCore.Ffmpeg nuget package, the native ffmpeg binaries should be copied automatically to the bin directory during the build process.
Some VS version still have problems to do that (for example VS 2013 NuGet Package Manager 2.9).
For that case, go to [YourVSProjectDirectory]\packages\CSCore.Ffmpeg[version]\build\ and copy the whole FFmpeg directory to your output directory (typically [YourVSProjectDirectory]\bin\[Debug/Release]\).
